## CREATE A ROLE IN WHICH LAMBDA FUNCTIONS HAVE FULL ACCESS TO EC2 INSTANCE
# CREATE A FUNCTIONS OF PYTHON LANGUAGE WHICH IS KNOWN AS LAMBDA FUNCTION THEN GIVE IT THAT PARTICULAR ROLE SO IT CAN ACCES OUR INSTANCES
#TO STOP EC2 INSTANCE 

import boto3

# Define the AWS region and the EC2 instance IDs
region = 'us-east-1'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Stop EC2 instances
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)

# THEN TEST THE CODE AND THEN DEPLOY IT 

#TO START EC2 INSTANCE

# AFTER THIS CREATE A SCHEDULAR IN CLOUD EVENT TRIGGER
# ALSO CREATE A ROLE IN WHICH CLOUD WATCH EVENT TRIGGER HAVE ACCESS TO LAMBDA FUNCTIONS TO CALL IT 
SET CRON AND DONE ?
